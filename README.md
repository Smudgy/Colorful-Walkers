This repository consists of some html5 canvas projects that have kept me busy. Mostly designed for [Wallpaper engine](http://store.steampowered.com/app/431960).

## [Colorful-Walkers](https://smudgy.github.io/html5-canvas-projects/colorful_music_walkers/)
Colored Dots on screen that leave a trail behind. The use of Wallpaper engine will allow for lots of customization options and interactivity on incoming sound.

## [Gumball Grid](https://smudgy.github.io/html5-canvas-projects/gumball%20grid)
Grid made of morphing shapes, based on the mouse's position.
This project was built using [the p5.js library](https://p5js.org/).

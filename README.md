This repository consists of some html5 canvas projects that have kept me busy. Mostly designed for [Wallpaper engine](http://store.steampowered.com/app/431960).

## [Colorful-Walkers](https://smudgy.github.io/html5-canvas-projects/colorful_music_walkers/)
Colored Dots on screen that leave a trail behind. The use of Wallpaper engine will allow for lots of customization options and interactivity on incoming sound.
